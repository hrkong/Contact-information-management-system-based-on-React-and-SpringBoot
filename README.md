# Contact-information-management-system-based-on-React-and-SpringBoot
This project uses react and SpringBoot frameworks provided by Professor Li Hongwen of Shandong University. On this basis, I developed the contact information management system.<br>
I designed the front-end react requirement and realized the back-end SpringBoot interface and Mysql database design by myself.
# Main functions:  
* The basic function of adding, deleting, modifying and checking the contact information on the front page.   
* Paging query and fuzzy query of contact information.  
* The contact information statistics and chart display function.
